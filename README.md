I am trying to build a Game called Connect_Four.
The reason why i want to build it is because i want to see if programing video games is what i want to do in the future.
It will be useful for entertaining people and giving something people can play when bored.


The way that you can play the ConnectFour games is PlayerOne goes with by clicking the spot he or she want to put the disc and then playerTwo does the same thing,
until one of them have four discs in a role.



Estimate of effort:
I think it will take alot of effort and searching how to do stuff because it is going to take alot of effort because i have no clue how to do any of it.
