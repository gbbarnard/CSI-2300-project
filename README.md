I am trying to build a Game called Tic-Tac-Toe.
The reason why i want to build it is because i want to see if programing video games is what i want to do in the future.
It will be useful for entertaining people and giving something people can play when bored.


The way the game is going play out is that the player will fight against an AI on different Diffcult levels or another player to see whos the winner is or draw.


Plan:

1st:
I plan on building the board structure for the game. 

2nd:
I plan on working the player ability to pick their symbol(x or o) and be able to place it on the board.

3rd:
The last thing is I plan on doing is working the AI, making sure it can place a smybol on the board and not overlapping with the player.


Estimate of effort:
I think it will take alot of effort and searching how to do stuff because it is going to take alot of effort because i have no clue how to do any of it.
